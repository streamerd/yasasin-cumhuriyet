# In the beloved memory of 

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Türkiye; 

and all that courageous, generous and artful people, dedicated themselves for modernization and regeneration of country that suffered for a century of misery.

Our people's artfulness on the first 15 years of our republic, been inspiring, encouraging and empowering the revolt against colonisation all around the world.

Today, 29.10.2022, celebrating 99th, recognised anniversary of our resilience in self-determination after the World War I; that have been the best case scenario resonating the time back then, even ahead of it in many sense.
